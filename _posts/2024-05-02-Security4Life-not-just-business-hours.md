|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Router         | - Close all unnecessary ports<br> - Change admin credentials<br> - Change name of the network and use strong access password<br> - Segregate the network (config Guest Wifi) for lot, home visitors...<br> - Smart devices (IoTs) only on Guest Wifi |
| MFA            | - Security key for MFA (e.g. Yubikey)<br> - Use 2 phone numbers (one not shared - for bank and other sensitive MFA authentications) to avoid SIM swapping<br> - Charge/plug your phone only to your cables/adapters (avoid public or unknown) |
| Crypto         | - Hardware wallet (Cold Storage for crypto - e.g. Ledger)<br> - Exchanges (bad) and hot wallets are less secure<br> - Backup your keys on paper and store in 2 different places |
| Information storage | - NAS (e.g. Synology or RaspberryPi NAS project!)<br>   - Run VMs<br>   - Storage/Backup<br>   - Photo management... |
 
## Software

|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Email          | - Most email services have GOOD security but BAD privacy (e.g. Gmail, Outlook). Choose services with GOOD privacy and GOOD Security (e.g. ProtonMail, Tutanota) |
| Passwords      | - Use a Password Manager (e.g. 1Password, Bitwarden - open source)                                         |
| Cloud storage  | - Prefer local backup, if not, use encryption (e.g. Cryptomator)                                            |
| Privacy        | - Use NextDNS for more fine-tuning (alternatives: RadioSignal, Little Snitch)<br> - Use VPN (e.g. NordVPN, ProtonVPN)<br> - Use DuckDuckGo instead of Google<br> - Use Yubikey authenticator instead of Google, Microsoft... |
| Others         | - Avoid FREE software (if it is free, you are the product)<br> - Use open-source software when available<br> - Utilize Docker to run several LLM locally, no wifi needed (e.g. Llama) |

| - Prioritize Security AND Privacy first<br> - Be suspicious - don't trust, verify. If it looks like, smells like, and tastes like something malicious, it probably is<br> - Avoid using cloud storage for sensitive information<br> - Remember "Cloud" = someone else's computer<br> - Practice email compartmentalization (Professional, Family, Spam, Banks...)<br> - Remove metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP) from photos before posting online<br> - Avoid publicly announcing travel plans until after returning<br> - Avoid connecting to public wifi without using a VPN<br> - Regularly check for leaks on personal emails (e.g. Intelx)<br> - Conduct regular OSINT lookups on yourself to assess public exposure<br> - Harden mobile security configurations<br> - Maintain regular backups of personal files on two separate drives in different locations (e.g. CarbonCopyCloner, TimeMachine...)<br> - Share and educate friends and family about security best practices |
