Licenses are the silent architects of digital goods, quietly shaping how we share and build upon ideas. From the open arms of licenses like GNU GPL to the flexible permissions of Creative Commons, they empower creators and users, fostering collaboration and progress. They offer structure, guiding us towards a future where knowledge is shared and cultivated for everyone's benefit. 

This is why open source is the beating heart of innovation, where ideas flourish and boundaries blur. By embracing transparency and collaboration, open source democratizes access to technology, empowering people and communities to shape the digital future. Supporting open source isn't just about software; it's about embracing a culture of sharing, learning, and collective growth. It's about fostering creativity without constraints, driving progress that transcends individual interests. So, whether you're a developer, a user, or simply a believer in the power of open collaboration, supporting open source is a vote for a more inclusive, sustainable future where knowledge is freely accessible to all. Here's some of the most common types of licenses used, open source and not so open :)

**Artistic License 2.0**

- This is a license for software packages with the intent of giving the original copyright holder some measure of control over his software while still remaining open source.

- The AGPL license differs from the other GNU licenses in that it was built for network software. You can distribute modified versions if you keep track of the changes and the date you made them. As per usual with GNU licenses, you must license derivatives under AGPL. It provides the same restrictions and freedoms as the GPLv3 but with an additional clause which makes it so that source code must be distributed along with web publication. Since web sites and services are never distributed in the traditional sense, the AGPL is the GPL of the web.Publicly Available

**Mozilla Public License 2.0**

- This is a lenient license used by the Mozilla Corporation that allows you a variety of explicit freedoms with the software so long as you keep modifications under this license and distribute the original source code alongside executables. It is a good midway license; it isn’t very strict and has only straightforward requirements.Publicly Available

- You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are described inside the modified files and licensed for free under LGPL-2.1.

**GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)**

- You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are described inside the modified files and licensed for free under LGPL-2.1.

**Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL-1.0)**

- This is a very permissive and popular license made by Sun Microsystems that also includes explicit patent grants. It is relatively simplistic in its conditions, requiring only a small amount of documentation for redistribution (applying to source as well as modified code).Publicly Available

- A short, permissive software license. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license.Publicly Available

**The BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License (BSD)**

- The BSD 2-clause license allows you almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the BSD copyright notice in it.Publicly Available
